Hey my name is David Robson and I'm 27 years old. I live in Newbury, England and partly grew up in Münster, Germany where my father was stationed in the British Army.

I've been interested in computers for long time, of course starting from playing games :). My interest grew in my teens and I went to College then University studying Computer Science. Learnt Java and whammy got a Java job for a telecoms company writing full stack applications.

After a while of Java I started to get interested in more Web Technologies, omg no compiling :), first JavaScript, NodeJS and then AngularJS. That interest has now taken me to become a Web Developer working for Appsbroker.

So my blog will be mostly discussing Web Technologies, in what language? in what framework? who knows!? But im hoping someone, somewhere will find it useful :).
